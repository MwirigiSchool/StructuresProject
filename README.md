### Farm Management System
This is a simple Farm Management System implemented in C. It allows users to populate a farm with animals, specifying their details such as tag number, name, age, type, weight, gender, number of offsprings, and breed. Users can then view the details of the animals stored in the farm.

## Files
main.c: Contains the main function to run the program.
function.c: Contains the implementation of functions to populate the farm and print its details.
function.h: Header file containing function prototypes, enums, and struct definitions.
Makefile: Makefile for compiling the program.
## Compilation
To compile the program, run the following command:
make
## Usage
After compiling the program, run the executable main:
./main
Follow the prompts to populate the farm with animals. You will be asked to provide details such as tag number, name, age, type, weight, gender, number of offsprings, and breed for each animal.

Once the farm is populated, you can view the details of the animals stored in the farm.
